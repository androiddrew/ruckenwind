# Ruckenwind

A Pelican Theme inspired by https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-clean-blog and it's Pelican https://github.com/gilsondev/pelican-clean-blog theme. Reimplemented in Tailwind, because I like it better. 

Technically, it's supposed to be "r√ºckenwind" with an umlaut, but I am silly Americans so I dropped it. It means "tailwind" in German, and I chose it because I use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for this theme's styling.

## Markdown

I have only tested this theme with Markdown content.

I have found this guide to be one of the best markdown guides available: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/. The tailwind typography plugin used in this project has full styling support for all items processed by the markdown engine.

## Header Images and Overlays

When using a header image with the `HEADER_COVER` configuration option, it may be advantageous to use a transparent overlay to make the navbar and h1 text more visible. We can use the `HEADER_COLOR` configuration option set to a safelisted background color in the `tailwind.conf.js` to achieve this outcome. 

By default we have safelisted the gray palatte, bu you can easily add additional colors.
```
  safelist: [
    'bg-gray-100',
    'bg-gray-200',
    'bg-gray-300',
    'bg-gray-400',
    'bg-gray-500',
    'bg-gray-600',
    'bg-gray-700',
    'bg-gray-800',
    'bg-gray-900',
  ],
```

## Getting started with dev

### Adding this submodule to your Pelican project

For an introduction in the use of git submodules see https://phoenixnap.com/kb/git-submodule.

Create a themes directory within your Pelican project, then add this repository as a git submodule.

```bash
mkdir themes
cd themes
git submodule add https://github.com/androiddrew/ruckenwind.git
```

### Building the CSS

To make changes to the templates you will first need install dependencies with npm

```bash
cd themes/ruckenwind/
npm install
```

Tailwind cli will only output to `./static/ruckenwind.css` the utility classes used in the `templates/` directories as configured in `tailwind.config.js`. Changes to these templates will require recompiling the css.

```bash
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./static/css/ruckenwind.css --watch
```

## Configuration

Here is a list of theme settings you can configure to alter aspects of the theme. The theme also supports most of the general settings that Pelican offers so I won't go into those here.

```python
